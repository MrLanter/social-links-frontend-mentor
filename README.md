## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For Twitter, Discord, ... links :
```html
<meta property="og:title" content="I am a title for Open Graph">
```

Open a link in a new page with `target="_blank` and get security with `rel="noopener noreferrer"` :
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
```

I learned how to use CSS custom properties
